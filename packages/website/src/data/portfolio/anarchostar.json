  "description": "<p>Anarchostar was a music label run by founder, DJ Distal. His goal for the site was to build a comicbook-like experience\n      that compliemented the music, with particular tracks pairing with different panels from the comic. The illustrations\n      were done by a Brazilian artist. I partnered with local graphic designers, Catherine Anne, to build the living web experience.</p>\n      <p>In order to make the site maintainable by Distal, I built the site using Wordpress and created a custom parallax theme\n      that supported his original vision.\n      </p>\n      ",
