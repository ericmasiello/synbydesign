Anarchostar was a music label run by founder, DJ Distal. His goal for the site was to build a comicbook-like experience
that complimented the music, with particular tracks pairing with different panels from the comic. The illustrations
were done by a Brazilian artist. I partnered with local graphic designers, Catherine Anne, to build the living web experience.

In order to make the site maintainable by Distal, I built the site using Wordpress and created a custom parallax theme
that supported his original vision.
