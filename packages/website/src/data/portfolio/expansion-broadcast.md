Expansion Broadcast (EXBC) was a podcast I co-founded and operated with the aid of my crewmates for over 10 years.
EXBC focused on underground electronic music in the Washington, DC area. EXBC launched as an internet radio show, then
transitioned to a live Friday evening event, and eventually found its calling as a weekly podcast.

I managed the weekly DJ schedule, day-to-day operations, design, and maintenance of the website. I was also a primary
contributor of mixes under the monikers IllEfect, Erictronica, and D-FECT.
