  "description": "\n      <p>Expansion Broadcast (EXBC) was a podcast I cofounded and ran with the aid of my crewmates for over 10 years. EXBC went through many iterations. Initially it focused as an internet radio broadcast, then a live Friday evening event, and finally\n      found its calling as a weekly podcast focusing on underground electronic music in the Washington, DC area.</p>\n      <p>I managed the weekly DJ schedule, day-to-day operations, design, and maintenance of the website.</p>\n    ",
