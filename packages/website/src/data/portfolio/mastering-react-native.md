> Leverage frontend development skills to build impressive iOS and Android applications with React Native.

I coauthored _Mastering React Native_ with my co-instructor from General Assembly, Jacob Friedmann.
When asked by Packt to write this book, I had zero experience as a professional writer but was excited
to share my optimism for React Native with the developer community. I, like many developers, come
from a web/JavaScript background. I've worked with other "JS to Native" frameworks but always found
myself disappointed with the result. React Native offers something different: write your UI using the
familiar, declarative syntax of JSX and React but still achieve near-native app performance.
