When asked by Packt to write this book,\n      I had zero experience as a professional writer but was excited to share my optimism for React Native with the developer community.\n      I, like many developers, come from a web/JavaScript background. I&rsquo;ve worked with other &ldquo;JS to Native&rdquo; frameworks\n      but always found myself disappointed with the result. React Native offers something different: write your UI using the familiar,\n      declarative syntax of JSX and React but still achieve near-native app performance.\n      </p>\n    ",
