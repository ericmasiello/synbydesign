Apple Juice was a series of electronic music events in Washington, DC hosted by
Harry Ranson, Ray Casil, and I under the moniker DJ IllEffect (and occasionally as Erictronica).
This particular instance of Apple Juice featured international DJ/producer DFRNT.
The idea for this flyer design was to blend Apple Computer's old marketing campaign
_Think Different_ with DFRNT's peculiar DJ name and branding.
