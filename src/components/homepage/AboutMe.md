## <span aria-label="waving hand">ðŸ‘‹</span> Hi. I'm Eric Masiello, and this is what I do.

I am a distinguished software engineer and domain architect at [Vista](https://vista.com/), where my teams and I develop our do-it-yourself (DIY) design software. For the past few years, I've focused on scaling VistaPrint's flagship design software, Studio6. I've led our initial migration from a Backbone/Redux/React software stack to a modern React & MobX stack. Along the way, I've helped redesign our software by transforming a monolithic application into a platform built upon custom-designed integration frameworks that offer clear, typesafe integration patterns for our many engineering contributors.

Beyond my day-to-day responsibilities, I invest in building our front-end culture and knowledge at Vista. I mentor engineers on specific focus areas: testing, accessibility, and performance. I help these "champions" build and execute plans that improve our software in these often overlooked areas. I also work closely with our technology leaders, creating in-house training and finding ways to adopt standard approaches, best practices, and tooling across the entire organization.

I have an "unusual" love for writing unit and integration tests. I take inspiration from the great Kent C. Dodds and have [turned my testing philosophy into an internal course at Vista](https://gitlab.com/ericmasiello/testing-react-workshop).

Lastly, I love to tinker with the edges of web and user interface development. Being a self-proclaimed Apple fan who loves to build UIs, I've taught myself a reasonable amount of Swift and SwiftUI. I used this to launch an [Apple Watch/iOS/iPad app in the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tap-4-bpm/id1521303621) that counts beats per minute when listening to music. I'm now building a new, more sophisticated iPad application that I hope one day will help my kids _stay in bed!_ <span aria-label="crying laughing face">ðŸ¤£</span>
