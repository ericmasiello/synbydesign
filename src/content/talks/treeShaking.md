description: "While we'd like to believe build tools will always magically \"do the right thing,\" in reality, we must author JavaScript libraries \"correctly\" to support the diverse environments we'll want to execute our code. This talk explains the impact CommonJS and ES Modules have on these environments. It compares Rollup to Webpack, explaining when each is the appropriate choice. And finally, it touches on \"side effects\" and how to mitigate their impact on code bundles."
