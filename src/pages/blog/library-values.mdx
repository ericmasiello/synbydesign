A few years ago, I was tapped by internal leaders at Vista to develop a "design experience platform." I had a few UI libraries under my belt and was experienced with general UI development as well as UI build tools. I was excited to shift away from the work I had most of my career: customer facing application development. In my new role as platform architect, my customers are developers at Vista that want to build design experiences across the website.

Having both consumeed and built several component libraries, over time I developed a position that UI libraries are at their best when they are highly flexible. Reflecting back, I developed this value because I saw how often UX designers would unknowingly "bend the rules" of components I developed. For example, a component only called for a vertically stacked treatment of two elements. But now our designers are asking for a horizontally arranged treatment. Sometimes, the UX problem could be solved with the original stacked treatment. But other times, due to circumstanstances specific to this page, application, or view, a new version was required. Using Brad Frost's "Atomic Design" metaphor, I consequently shifted my focus toward exposing the "atoms" of a design, leaving much of the larger component composition (molecules) to the consuming application code.

## Designing the atoms of design

(What does it mean to ship the atoms of a design experience? What was i repsonsible for?

- Managing and opterating on data sources that are unique for a DEX.
- Delivering composable components for UI for editing text, accessibility (focus state), panning, previews, etc.
  )

(What I delivered was a a bunch hooks, providers, and components)

## Where my values didn't align with our customers

## The silver bullet

We could still ship what was customers wanted with our components

## Lessons learned

- Building the right abstraction is hard.
- I aspired for an audience that I didn't have
- Building small components still makes sense because, if nothing else, it provides the internal team the primitives for developing more complex interfaces
- But what I initially shipped missed the mark
